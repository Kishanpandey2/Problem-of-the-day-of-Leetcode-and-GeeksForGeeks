109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree  =>
-----------------------------------------------


Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a 
height-balanced
 binary search tree.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
Example 2:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
