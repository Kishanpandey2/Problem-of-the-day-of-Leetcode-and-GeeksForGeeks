Smaller Sum  =>
-----------



You are given an array arr of n integers. For each index i, you have to find the sum of all integers present in the array with a value less than arr[i].

Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
arr = {1, 2, 3}
Output:
0 1 3
Explanation:
For 1, there are no elements lesser than itself.
For 2, only 1 is lesser than 2.
And for 3, 1 and 2 are lesser than 3, so the sum is 3.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 2
arr = {4, 4}
Output:
0 0
Explanation:
For 4, there are no elements lesser than itself. 
For 4, there are no elements lesser than itself.
There are no smaller elements than 4.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function smallerSum() which takes an integer n and an array arr and returns an array of length n , the answer for every index.

Expected Time Complexity:O(n log n)
Expected Space Complexity:O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 109
