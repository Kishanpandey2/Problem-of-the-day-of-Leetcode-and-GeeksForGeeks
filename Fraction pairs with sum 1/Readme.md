Fraction pairs with sum 1  =>
-------------------------


Given a list of N fractions, represented as two lists numerator and denominator, the task is to determine the count of pairs of fractions whose sum equals 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
numerator = [1, 2, 2, 8]
denominator = [2, 4, 6, 12]
Output:
2
Explanation:
Fractions 1/2 and 2/4 sum to 1. Similarly fractions 2/6 and 8/12 sum to 1. So there are 2 pairs of fractions which sum to 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
numerator = [3, 1, 12, 81, 2]
denominator = [9, 10, 18, 90, 5]
Output:
2
Explanation:
Fractions 3/9 and 12/18 sum to 1. Similarly fractions 1/10 and 81/90 sum to 1. So there are 2 pairs of fractions which sum to 1.
Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countFractions() which take integer N and arrays numerator and denominator of size N as arguments, and returns an integer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <=105
1 <= numerator[i] <= denominator[i] <= 109
