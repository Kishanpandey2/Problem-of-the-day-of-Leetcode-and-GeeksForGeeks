Longest Common Prefix of Strings  =>
--------------------------------


Given an array of strings arr. Return the longest common prefix among all strings present in the array. If there's no prefix common in all the strings, return "-1".

Examples :

Input: arr[] = ["geeksforgeeks", "geeks", "geek", "geezer"]
Output: gee
Explanation: "gee" is the longest common prefix in all the given strings.
Input: arr[] = ["hello", "world"]
Output: -1
Explanation: There's no common prefix in the given strings.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*min(|arri|))
Expected Space Complexity: O(min(|arri|))

Constraints:
1 ≤ |arr| ≤ 103
1 ≤ |arr[i]| ≤ 103
