Binary representation of next number  =>
------------------------------------


Given a binary representation in the form of a string(s) of a number n, the task is to find a binary representation of n+1.

Note: Output binary string should not contain leading zeros.

Example 1:

Input: s = "10"
Output: 11
Explanation: "10" is the binary representation of 2 and binary representation of 3 is "11"
Example 2:

Input: s = "111"
Output: 1000
Explanation: "111" is the binary representation of 7 and binary representation of 8 is "1000"
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function binaryNextNumber()which takes s as input parameter and returns the string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n) to store resultant string  

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
