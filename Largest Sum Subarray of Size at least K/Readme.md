Largest Sum Subarray of Size at least K  =>
----------------------------------------


Given an array a of length n and a number k, find the largest sum of the subarray containing at least k numbers. It is guaranteed that the size of array is at-least k.

Example 1:

Input : 
n = 4
a[] = {1, -2, 2, -3}
k = 2
Output : 
1
Explanation :
The sub-array of length at-least 2
that produces greatest sum is {1, -2}
Example 2:
Input :
n = 6 
a[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
k = 2
Output : 
6
Explanation :
The sub-array of length at-least 2
that produces greatest sum is {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxSumWithK() which takes the array a[], its size n and an integer k as inputs and returns the value of the largest sum of the subarray containing at least k numbers.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
-105 <= a[i] <= 105
1 <= k <= n
