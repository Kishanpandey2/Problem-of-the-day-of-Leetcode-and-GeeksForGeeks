Non Repeating Numbers  =>
---------------------



Given an array A containing 2*N+2 positive numbers, out of which 2*N numbers exist in pairs whereas the other two number occur exactly once and are distinct. Find the other two numbers. Return in increasing order.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 2
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4}
Output:
3 4 
Explanation:
3 and 4 occur exactly once.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 1
arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 2}
Output:
1 3
Explanation:
1 3 occur exactly once.
Your Task:
You do not need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function singleNumber() which takes the array as input parameter and returns a list of two numbers which occur exactly once in the array. The list must be in ascending order.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= length of array <= 106 
1 <= Elements in array <= 5 * 106
