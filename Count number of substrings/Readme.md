Count number of substrings  =>
---------------------------


Given a string of lowercase alphabets, count all possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that have exactly k distinct characters. 

Example 1:

Input:
S = "aba", K = 2
Output:
3
Explanation:
The substrings are: "ab", "ba" and "aba".
Example 2:

Input: 
S = "abaaca", K = 1
Output:
7
Explanation:
The substrings are: "a", "b", "a", "aa", "a", "c", "a". 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function substrCount() which takes the string S and an integer K as inputs and returns the number of substrings having exactly K distinct characters.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 106
1 ≤ K ≤ 26
