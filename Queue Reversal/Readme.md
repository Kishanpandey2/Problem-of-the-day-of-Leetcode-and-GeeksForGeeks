Queue Reversal  =>
---------------


Given a Queue Q containing N elements. The task is to reverse the Queue. Your task is to complete the function rev(), that reverses the N elements of the queue.

Example 1:

Input:
6
4 3 1 10 2 6
Output: 
6 2 10 1 3 4
Explanation: 
After reversing the given elements of the queue , the resultant queue will be 6 2 10 1 3 4.
Example 2:

Input:
4
4 3 2 1 
Output: 
1 2 3 4
Explanation: 
After reversing the given elements of the queue , the resultant queue will be 1 2 3 4.
Your Task: You need to complete the function rev that takes a queue as parameter and returns the reversed queue. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ elements of Queue ≤ 105
