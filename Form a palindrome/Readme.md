Form a palindrome  =>
------------------


Given a string, find the minimum number of characters to be inserted to convert it to a palindrome.

Examples :

Input: str = "abcd"
Output: 3
Explanation: Inserted character marked with bold characters in dcbabcd, here we need minimum three characters to make it palindrome.
Input: str = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: "aa" is already a palindrome.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |str| ≤ 500
str contains only lowercase alphabets.
