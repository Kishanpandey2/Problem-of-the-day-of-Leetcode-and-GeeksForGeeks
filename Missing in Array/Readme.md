Missing in Array  =>
----------------


Given an array arr of size n−1 that contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to n (inclusive), find the missing element. The array is a permutation of size n with one element missing. Return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [1,2,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: n = 2, arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 2 are present except 2.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
