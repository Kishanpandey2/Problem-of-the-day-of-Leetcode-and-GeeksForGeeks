Eventual Safe States  =>
---------------------


A directed graph of V vertices and E edges is given in the form of an adjacency list adj. Each node of the graph is labelled with a distinct integer in the range 0 to V - 1.

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.

You have to return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

Example 1:

Input:


Output:
2 4 5 6
Explanation:
The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no 
outgoing edges from either of them. 
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all 
lead to either node 5 or 6.
Example 2:

Input:


Output:
3
Explanation:
Only node 3 is a terminal node, and every path 
starting at node 3 leads to node 3.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function eventualSafeNodes() which takes an integer V denoting no. of vertices and adj denoting adjacency list of the graph and returns an array of safe nodes.

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)

Expected Space Complexity: O(V)

Constraints:

1 <= V <= 104
0 <= E <= 104
The graph won't contain self loops.
Each node in the graph has a distinct value in the range 0 to V - 1.
