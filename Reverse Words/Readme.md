Given a String str, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by dots.

Note: The last character has not been '.'. 

Examples :

Input: str = i.like.this.program.very.much
Output: much.very.program.this.like.i
Explanation: After reversing the whole string(not individual words), the input string becomes much.very.program.this.like.i
Input: str = pqr.mno
Output: mno.pqr
Explanation: After reversing the whole string , the input string becomes mno.pqr
Expected Time Complexity: O(|str|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|str|)

Constraints:
1 <= |str| <= 105
