Fibonacci series up to Nth term  =>
-------------------------------


You are given an integer n, return the fibonacci series till the nth(0-based indexing) term. Since the terms can become very large return the terms modulo 109+7.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5
Explanation:
0 1 1 2 3 5 is the Fibonacci series up to the 5th term.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 10
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
Explanation:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 is the Fibonacci series up to the 10th term.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function Series() which takes an Integer n as input and returns a Fibonacci series up to the nth term.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

Constraint:
1 <= n <= 105
