Count Total Setbits  =>
-------------------


 

You are given a number N. Find the total number of setbits in the numbers from 1 to N. 

Example 1:

Input: N = 3
Output: 4
Explaination: 
1 -> 01, 2 -> 10 and 3 -> 11. 
So total 4 setbits.
Example 2:

Input: N = 4
Output: 5
Explaination: 1 -> 01, 2 -> 10, 3 -> 11 
and 4 -> 100. So total 5 setbits.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countBits() which takes N as input parameter and returns the total number of setbits upto N.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
