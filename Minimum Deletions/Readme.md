Minimum Deletions  =>
-----------------


Given a string of S as input. Your task is to write a program to delete the minimum number of characters from the string so that the resultant string is a palindrome.
Note: The order of characters in the string should be maintained.

Example 1:

Input: 
S = "aebcbda"
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
Remove characters 'e' and 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: 
S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 
8
Explanation: 
One of the possible result string can be "eefee", so answer is 13 - 5 = 8.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minimumNumberOfDeletions() which takes the string S as inputs and returns the minimum number of deletions required to convert S into a pallindrome.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 103
