Find element occuring once when all other are present thrice  =>
------------------------------------------------------------


Given an array of integers arr[] of length N, every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.
Find that element which occurs once.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 10, 1, 1}
Output:
10
Explanation:
10 occurs once in the array while the other
element 1 occurs thrice.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
arr[] = {3, 2, 1, 34, 34, 1, 2, 34, 2, 1}
Output:
3
Explanation:
All elements except 3 occurs thrice in the array.
Your Task:
You do not need to take any input or print anything. You task is to complete the function singleElement() which takes an array of integers arr and an integer N which finds and returns the element occuring once in the array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
-109 ≤ A[i] ≤ 109

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
