Distinct occurrences =>
--------------------


Given two strings s and t of length n and m respectively. Find the count of distinct occurrences of t in s as a sub-sequence modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "banana" , t = "ban"
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
There are 3 sub-sequences:[ban], [ba n], [b an].
Example 2:

Input:
s = "geeksforgeeks" , t = "ge"
Output: 
6
Explanation: 
There are 6 sub-sequences:[ge], [ge], [g e], [g e] [g e] and [g e].
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function subsequenceCount() which takes two strings as argument s and t and returns the count of the sub-sequences modulo 109 + 7.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*m).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n,m ≤ 1000
