Palindrome Linked List  =>
----------------------


Given a singly linked list of integers. The task is to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->1->1->2->1
Output: true
Explanation: The given linked list is 1->2->1->1->2->1 , which is a palindrome and Hence, the output is true.

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4
Output: false
Explanation: The given linked list is 1->2->3->4, which is not a palindrome and Hence, the output is false.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) 
Note: You should not use the recursive stack space as well

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 103
