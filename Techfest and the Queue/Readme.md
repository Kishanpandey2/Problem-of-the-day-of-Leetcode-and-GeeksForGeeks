Techfest and the Queue  =>
----------------------


A Techfest is underway, and each participant is given a ticket with a unique number. Organizers decide to award prize points to everyone who has a ticket ID between a and b (inclusive). The points given to a participant with ticket number x will be the sum of powers of the prime factors of x.

For instance, if points are to be awarded to a participant with ticket number 12, the amount of points given out will be equal to the sum of powers in the prime factorization of 12 (22 Ã— 31), which will be 2 + 1 = 3.

Given a and b, determine the sum of all the points that will be awarded to the participants with ticket numbers between a and b (inclusive).

Example 1:

Input: 
a = 9
b = 12
Output: 
8
Explanation: 
For 9, prime factorization is:32 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
For 10, prime factorization is : 21x51 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
For 11, prime factorization is : 111 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 1
For 12, prime factorization is : 22x 31 
So, sum of powers of primes is: 3
Therefore the total sum is 2+2+1+3=8.
Example 2:

Input: 
a = 24, b = 27
Output: 
11
Explanation: 
For 24, prime factorization is: 23x31 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 4
For 25, prime factorization is : 52 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
For 26, prime factorization is : 131x21 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
For 27, prime factorization is : 33  
So, sum of powers of primes is: 3
Therefore the total sum is 4+2+2+3=11.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sumOfPowers() which takes a and b as input parameters and returns the sum of the power of primes that occur in prime factorization of the numbers between a to b (inclusive).

Expected Time Complexity: O( b*log(b) )
Expected Space Complexity: O( b*log(b) )

Constraints:
1 <= a <= b <= 2x105
1 <= b-a <= 105
