Linked List that is Sorted Alternatingly  =>
----------------------------------------


You are given a Linked list of size n. The list is in alternating ascending and descending orders. Sort the given linked list in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
LinkedList = 1->9->2->8->3->7
Output: 1 2 3 7 8 9
Explanation: 
After sorting the given list will be 1->2->3->7->8->9.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
LinkedList = 13->99->21->80->50
Output: 13 21 50 80 99
Explanation:
After sorting the given list will be 13->21->50->80->99.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function sort() which should sort the linked list of size n in non-decreasing order. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 100
0 <= Values of the elements in linked list <= 103
