Longest Palindromic Subsequence  =>
=============================== 


Given a String, find the longest palindromic subsequence.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "bbabcbcab"
Output: 7
Explanation: Subsequence "babcbab" is the
longest subsequence which is also a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: 
S = "abcd"
Output: 1
Explanation: "a", "b", "c" and "d" are
palindromic and all have a length 1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function longestPalinSubseq() which takes the string S as input and returns an integer denoting the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of S.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|*|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|*|S|).

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000
