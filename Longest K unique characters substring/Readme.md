Longest K unique characters substring  =>
-------------------------------------



Given a string you need to print the size of the longest possible substring that has exactly K unique characters. If there is no possible substring then print -1.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "aabacbebebe", K = 3
Output: 
7
Explanation: 
"cbebebe" is the longest substring with 3 distinct characters.
Example 2:

Input: 
S = "aaaa", K = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There's no substring with 2 distinct characters.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function longestKSubstr() which takes the string S and an integer K as input and returns the length of the longest substring with exactly K distinct characters. If there is no substring with exactly K distinct characters then return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|).

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
1 ≤ K ≤ 26
All characters are lowercase latin characters.
