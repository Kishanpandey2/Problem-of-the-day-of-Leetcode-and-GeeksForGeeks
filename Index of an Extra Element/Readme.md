Index of an Extra Element  =>
 -------------------------

 
You have given two sorted arrays arr1[] & arr2[] of distinct elements. The first array has one element extra added in between. Return the index of the extra element.

Note: 0-based indexing is followed.

Examples

Input: n = 7, arr1[] = {2,4,6,8,9,10,12}, arr2[] = {2,4,6,8,10,12}
Output: 4
Explanation: In the first array, 9 is extra added and it's index is 4.
Input: n = 6, arr1[] = {3,5,7,8,11,13}, arr2[] = {3,5,7,11,13}
Output: 3
Explanation: In the first array, 8 is extra and it's index is 3.
Expected Time Complexity: O(log n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1<=n<=105
1<=arr1[i],arr2[i]<=106
