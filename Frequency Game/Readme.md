Frequency Game  =>
--------------


Given an array A of size N. The elements of the array consist of positive integers. You have to find the largest element with minimum frequency.

Example 1:

Input: 
5
2 2 5 50 1
Output:
50
Explanation :
All elements are having frequency 1 except 2.
50 is the maximum element with minimum frequency.
Example 2:

Input:
4
3 3 5 5
Output:
5
Explanation:
Both 3 and 5 have the same frequency, so 5 should be returned.
User Task:
Your task is to complete the provided function LargButMinFreq(A, n) which accepts array A and n. Hence you have to return the largest element with minimum frequency.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 106
