Level order traversal  =>
---------------------


Given a root of a binary tree with n nodes, find its level order traversal.
Level order traversal of a tree is breadth-first traversal for the tree.

Example 1:

Input:
    1
  /   \ 
 3     2
Output:
1 3 2
Example 2:

Input:
        10
     /      \
    20       30
  /   \
 40   60
Output:
10 20 30 40 60
Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Complete the function levelOrder() that takes the root node as input parameter and returns a list of integers containing the level order traversal of the given Binary Tree.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
0 ≤ Data of a node ≤ 109
