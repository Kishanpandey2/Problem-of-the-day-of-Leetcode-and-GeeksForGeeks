Reverse Bits  =>
------------


Given a number x, reverse its binary form and return the answer in decimal.

Example 1:

Input:
x = 1
Output:
2147483648 
Explanation:
Binary of 1 in 32 bits representation-
00000000000000000000000000000001
Reversing the binary form we get, 
10000000000000000000000000000000,
whose decimal value is 2147483648.
Example 2:

Input:
x = 5
Output:
2684354560 
Explanation:
Binary of 5 in 32 bits representation-
00000000000000000000000000000101
Reversing the binary form we get, 
10100000000000000000000000000000,
whose decimal value is 2684354560.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function reversedBits() which takes an Integer x as input and returns the reverse binary form of x in decimal form.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log (x))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
0  <=  x  <  232
