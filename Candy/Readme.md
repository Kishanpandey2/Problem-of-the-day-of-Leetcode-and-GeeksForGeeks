Candy  =>
-----


There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have atleast one candy.
Children with a higher rating than its neighbors get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
ratings = [1, 0, 2]
Output: 
5
Explanation: 
You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
ratings = [1, 2, 2]
Output: 
4
Explanation: 
You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it statisfies the above two conditions.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minCandy() which takes the interger N and integer array ratings as parameters and returns the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ ratingsi ≤ 109
