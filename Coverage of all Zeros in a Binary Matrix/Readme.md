Coverage of all Zeros in a Binary Matrix  =>
 ----------------------------------------

 
Given a binary matrix contains 0s and 1s only, we need to find the sum of coverage of all zeros of the matrix where coverage for a particular 0 is defined as a total number of ones around a zero in left, right, up and bottom directions.

Examples:

Input:
matrix = [[0, 1, 0],
          [0, 1, 1],
          [0, 0, 0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: There are a total of 6 coverage are there

Input: 
matrix = [[0, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are only 1 coverage.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n * m)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= matrix.size, matrix[0].size <= 100
