Remove every kth node  =>
---------------------


Given a singly linked list having n nodes, your task is to remove every kth node from the linked list. 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 8
linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 
k = 2
Output: 
1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7
Explanation: 
After removing every 2nd node of the linked list, the resultant linked list will be: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 10
linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 
k = 3
Output: 
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10
Explanation: 
After removing every 3rd node of the linked list, the resultant linked list will be: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function deleteK() which takes head of linked list and integer k as input parameters and delete every kth node from the linked list and return its head.

Expected Time Complexity :  O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space :  O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
-109 <= elements of linked list <= 109
1 <= k <= n
