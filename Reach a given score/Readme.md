-------------------


Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points in a move. Given a total score n, find number of distinct combinations to reach the given score.

Example 1:

Input
n = 10
Output
2

Example 2:

Input
n = 20
Output

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count( ) which takes n as input parameter and returns the answer to the problem.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 106
