------------------


Given an array arr containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.

Examples:

Input: arr[]= [0, 2, 1, 2, 0]
Output: 0 0 1 2 2
Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0]
Output: 0 0 1
Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 2
