Remainder on dividing by 11  =>
---------------------------


Given a big positive number x represented as string, find value of x % 11 or x mod 11. Output is expected as an integer.

Example 1:

Input: x = 1345
Output: 3
Explanation: 1345 % 11 = 3 
Example 1:

Input: x = 231456786543567898765
Output: 1
Explanation: 231456786543567898765 % 11 = 1

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function xmod11() which takes string x as the input parameter and returns the integer value of x%11.

Expected Time Complexity: O(length of string x)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of string x ≤ 100000
