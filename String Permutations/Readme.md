String Permutations  =>
-------------------


Given a string S. The task is to find all permutations (need not be different) of a given string.

Example 1:

Input:
S = AAA
Output: AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA
Explanation: There are total 6 permutations, as given in the output.
Example 2:

Input:
S = ABSG
Output: ABGS ABSG AGBS AGSB ASBG ASGB
BAGS BASG BGAS BGSA BSAG BSGA GABS
GASB GBAS GBSA GSAB GSBA SABG SAGB
SBAG SBGA SGAB SGBA
Explanation: There are total 24 permutations, as given in the output.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function permutation that takes S as parameter and returns the list of permutations in lexicographically increasing order. The newline is automatically added by driver code.

Constraints:
1 ≤ size of string ≤ 5

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * N!), N = length of string.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
