2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal  ->
-------- -----------------------------


You are given two 0-indexed arrays nums and cost consisting each of n positive integers.

You can do the following operation any number of times:

Increase or decrease any element of the array nums by 1.
The cost of doing one operation on the ith element is cost[i].

Return the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array nums become equal.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
Output: 8
Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
- Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
- Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
- Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array equal with a smaller cost.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length == cost.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 106
