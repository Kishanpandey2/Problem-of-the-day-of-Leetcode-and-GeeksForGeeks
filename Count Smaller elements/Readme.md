Count Smaller elements  =>
----------------------


Given an array arr containing non-negative integers. Count and return an array ans where ans[i] denotes the number of smaller elements on right side of arr[i].

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [12, 1, 2, 3, 0, 11, 4]
Output: [6, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
Explanation: There are 6 smaller elements right after 12. There is 1 smaller element right after 1. And so on.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are 0 smaller elements right after 1. There are 0 smaller elements right after 2. And so on.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i]  ≤ 108
