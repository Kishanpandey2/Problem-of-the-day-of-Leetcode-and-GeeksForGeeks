Knapsack with Duplicate Items =>
------------------------------

Given a set of N items, each with a weight and a value, represented by the array w and val respectively. Also, a knapsack with weight limit W.
The task is to fill the knapsack in such a way that we can get the maximum profit. Return the maximum profit.
Note: Each item can be taken any number of times.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 2
W = 3
val = {1, 1}
wt = {2, 1}
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
1.Pick the 2nd element thrice.
2.Total profit = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Also the total weight = 1 + 1 + 1  = 3 which is <= 3.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 4
W = 8
val[] = {6, 1, 7, 7}
wt[] = {1, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 
48
Explanation: 
The optimal choice is to pick the 1st element 8 times.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function knapSack() which takes the values N, W and the arrays val and wt as input parameters and returns the maximum possible value.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*W)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(W)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N, W ≤ 1000
1 ≤ val[i], wt[i] ≤ 100
