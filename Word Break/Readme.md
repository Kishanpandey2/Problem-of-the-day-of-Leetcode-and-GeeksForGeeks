Given a string s and a dictionary of n words dictionary, find out if a s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words. Return 1 if it is possible to break the s into a sequence of dictionary words, else return 0. 

Note: From the dictionary dictionary each word can be taken any number of times and in any order.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
s = "ilike"
dictionary = { "i", "like", "sam", "sung", "samsung", "mobile"}

Your Task:
Complete wordBreak() function which takes a string and list of strings as a parameter and returns 1 if it is possible to break words, else return 0. You don't need to read any input or print any output, it is done by driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: O(len(s)2)
Expected Space Complexity: O(len(s))

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 12
1 ≤ len(s) ≤ 1100
