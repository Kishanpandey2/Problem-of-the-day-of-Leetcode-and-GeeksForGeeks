Rightmost different bit ==>
-----------------------


Given two numbers M and N. The task is to find the position of the rightmost different bit in the binary representation of numbers. If both M and N are the same then return -1 in this case.

Example 1: 

Input: 
M = 11, N = 9
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
Binary representation of the given numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 2nd bit from right is different.
Example 2:

Input: 
M = 52, N = 4
Output: 
5
Explanation: 
Binary representation of the given numbers are: 110100 and 0100, 5th-bit from right is different.
User Task:
The task is to complete the function posOfRightMostDiffBit() which takes two arguments M and N and returns the position of first different bits in M and N from right. If both m and n are the same then return -1 in this case.

Expected Time Complexity: O(max(log M, log N)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
0 <= M, N <= 109
