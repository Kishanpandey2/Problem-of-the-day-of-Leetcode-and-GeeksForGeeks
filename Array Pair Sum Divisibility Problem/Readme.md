Array Pair Sum Divisibility Problem  =>
-----------------------------------

Given an array of integers nums and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.

Example 1 :

Input : 
nums = [9, 5, 7, 3]
k = 6
Output: 
True
Explanation: 
{(9, 3), (5, 7)} is a 
possible solution. 9 + 3 = 12 is divisible
by 6 and 7 + 5 = 12 is also divisible by 6.
Example 2:

Input : 
nums = [4, 4, 4]
k = 4
Output: 
False
Explanation: 
You can make 1 pair at max, leaving a single 4 unpaired.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function canPair() which takes array nums and k as input parameter and returns true if array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k otherwise returns false.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity : O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= length( nums ) <= 105
1 <= numsi <= 105
1 <= k <= 105
