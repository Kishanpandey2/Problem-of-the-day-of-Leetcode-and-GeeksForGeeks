Find the string in grid  =>
-----------------------



Given a 2D grid of n*m of characters and a word, find all occurrences of given word in grid. A word can be matched in all 8 directions at any point. Word is said to be found in a direction if all characters match in this direction (not in zig-zag form). The 8 directions are, horizontally left, horizontally right, vertically up, vertically down, and 4 diagonal directions.

Note: The returning list should be lexicographically smallest. If the word can be found in multiple directions starting from the same coordinates, the list should contain the coordinates only once. 

Example 1:

Input: 
grid = {{a,b,c},{d,r,f},{g,h,i}},
word = "abc"
Output: 
{{0,0}}
Explanation: 
From (0,0) we can find "abc" in horizontally right direction.
Example 2:

Input: 
grid = {{a,b,a,b},{a,b,e,b},{e,b,e,b}}
word = "abe"
Output: 
{{0,0},{0,2},{1,0}}
Explanation: 
From (0,0) we can find "abe" in right-down diagonal. 
From (0,2) we can find "abe" in left-down diagonal. 
From (1,0) we can find "abe" in horizontally right direction.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything, Your task is to complete the function searchWord() which takes grid and word as input parameters and returns a list containing the positions from where the word originates in any direction. If there is no such position then returns an empty list.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m*k) where k is constant
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= m <= 50
1 <= |word| <= 15
