Find Kth permutation  =>
--------------------  



Given two integers N (1<=N<=9) and K. Find the kth permutation sequence of first N natural numbers. Return the answer in string format.

Example 1:

Input: N = 4, K = 3
Output: 1324
Explanation: 
Permutations of first 4 natural numbers:
1234,1243,1324,1342,1423,1432.....
So the 3rd permutation is 1324. 
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, K = 5
Output: 312
Explanation: 
Permutations of first 3 natural numbers:
123,132,213,231,312,321.
So the 5th permutation is 312. 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthPermutation() which takes two integers N and K as input parameters and returns a string denoting the kth permutation.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 9
1 <= K <= N!
