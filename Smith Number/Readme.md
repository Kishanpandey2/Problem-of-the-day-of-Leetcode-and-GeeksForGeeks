Smith Number  =>
------------


Given a number n, the task is to find out whether this number is a Smith number or not. A Smith number is a composite number whose sum of digits is equal to the sum of digits of its prime factors.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
Output:
1
Explanation:
The sum of the digits of 4 is 4, and the sum of the digits of its prime factors is 2 + 2 = 4.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 378
Output:
1
Explanation:
378 = 21*33*71 is a Smith number since 3+7+8 = 2*1+3*3+7*1.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function smithNum() which takes an Integer n as input and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n * log(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
