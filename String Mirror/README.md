String Mirror  =>
-------------



You are given a string str of length n. You want to choose a non-zero integer k (k<=n), such that you can perform the following operation:
Take the prefix of the string of length k and append the reverse of it to itself.
Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest string you can get.

Example 1:

Input:
str = "bvdfndkn"
Output:
bb
Explanation:
If we choose k=1, prefix of length k will be "b", reverse of
this prefix will be "b" itself, when we append both we get "bb",
"bb" is the lexicographically smallest string you can get.
If you choose k>1, the resulting string will not be 
lexicographically smaller than "bb".
Example 2:

Input:
str = "casd"
Output:
caac
Explanation:
If we choose k=2, prefix of length k will be "ca", reverse of
this prefix will be "ac", when we append both we get "caac",
"caac" is the lexicographically smallest string you can get.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function stringMirror() which takes a String str as input, and returns the lexicographically smallest string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|str|)
Expected Space Complexity: O(|str|)

Constraints:
1 <= |str| <= 105
