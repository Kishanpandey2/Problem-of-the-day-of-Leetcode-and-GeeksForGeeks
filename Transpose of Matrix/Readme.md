Transpose of Matrix  =>
--------------------


Write a program to find the transpose of a square matrix of size N*N. Transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
mat[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
           {2, 2, 2, 2}
           {3, 3, 3, 3}
           {4, 4, 4, 4}}
Output: 
{{1, 2, 3, 4},  
 {1, 2, 3, 4}  
 {1, 2, 3, 4}
 {1, 2, 3, 4}} 
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
mat[][] = {{1, 2},
           {-9, -2}}
Output:
{{1, -9}, 
 {2, -2}}

Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function transpose() which takes matrix[][] and N as input parameter and finds the transpose of the input matrix. You need to do this in-place. That is you need to update the original matrix with the transpose. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103
-109 <= mat[i][j] <= 109
