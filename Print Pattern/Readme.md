Print Pattern =>
-------------  


Print a sequence of numbers starting with N, without using loop, where replace N with N - 5, until N > 0. After that replace N with N + 5 until N regains its initial value.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 16
Output: 
16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
Explaination: 
The value decreases until it is greater than 0. After that it increases and stops when it becomes 16 again.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 10
Output: 
10 5 0 5 10
Explaination: It follows the same logic as per the above example.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function pattern() which takes N as input parameters and returns a list containing the pattern.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
-105 ≤ N ≤ 105
