Equilibrium Point =>
-----------------



Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first equilibrium point in an array. Equilibrium point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Note: Return equilibrium point in 1-based indexing. Return -1 if no such point exists. 

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 
3 
Explanation:  
equilibrium point is at position 3 as sum of elements before it (1+3) = sum of elements after it (2+2). 
Example 2:

Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}
Output: 
1
Explanation:
Since there's only element hence its only the equilibrium point.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function equilibriumPoint() which takes the array and n as input parameters and returns the point of equilibrium. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
