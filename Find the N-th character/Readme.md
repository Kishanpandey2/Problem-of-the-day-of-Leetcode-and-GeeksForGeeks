Find the N-th character  >
-----------------------


Given a binary string s. Perform r iterations on string s, where in each iteration 0 becomes 01 and 1 becomes 10. Find the nth character (considering 0 based indexing) of the string after performing these r iterations (see examples for better understanding).

Example 1:

Input:
s = "1100"
r = 2
n = 3
Output:
1
Explanation: 
After 1st iteration s becomes "10100101".
After 2nd iteration s becomes "1001100101100110".
Now, we can clearly see that the character at 3rd index is 1, and so the output.
Example 2:

Input:
s = "1010"
r = 1
n = 2
Output:
0
Explanation : 
After 1st iteration s becomes "10011001".
Now, we can clearly see that the character at 2nd index is 0, and so the output.
Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function nthCharacter() which takes the string s and integers r and n as input parameters and returns the n-th character of the string after performing r operations on s.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(r*|s|)
Expected Auxilary Space: O(|s|)
 
Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 103
1 ≤ r ≤ 20
0 ≤ n < |s|
