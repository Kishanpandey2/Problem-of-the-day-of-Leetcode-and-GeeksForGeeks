Sum of all substrings of a number  =>
---------------------------------


Given an integer s represented as a string, the task is to get the sum of all possible sub-strings of this string.
As the answer will be large, return answer modulo 109+7. 

Note: The number may have leading zeros.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "1234"
Output: 
1670
Explanation: 
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 12 + 23 + 34 + 123 + 234 + 1234 = 1670
Example 2:

Input:
s = "421"
Output: 
491
Explanation: 
Sum = 4 + 2 + 1 + 42 + 21 + 421 = 491
Your Task:
You only need to complete the function sumSubstrings that takes s as an argument and returns the answer modulo 109+7.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|s|).

Constraints:
1 <= |s| <= 105
