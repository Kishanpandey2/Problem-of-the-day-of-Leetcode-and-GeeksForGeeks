783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes =>
---------------------------------------


Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 105
