Determinant of a Matrix  =>
-----------------------


Given a square matrix of size n*n. The task is to find the determinant of this matrix.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
matrix[][] = {{1, 0, 2, -1},
              {3, 0, 0, 5},
              {2, 1, 4, -3},
              {1, 0, 5, 0}}
Output: 30
Explanation:
Determinant of the given matrix is 30.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3
matrix[][] = {{1, 2, 3},
              {4, 5, 6},
              {7, 10, 9}}
Output: 12
Explanation:
Determinant of the given matrix is 12.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function determinantOfMatrix() that takes matrix and its size n as input parameters and returns the determinant of the matrix.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N4)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10
-10 <= mat[i][j] <= 10
